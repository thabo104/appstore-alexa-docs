[Amazon Dash Replenishment Program Requirements](UPDATE-ME)

**AMAZON DASH REPLENISHMENT PROGRAM AGREEMENT**

**Last Updated:**  May 18, 2016

This Amazon Dash Replenishment Program Agreement governs your use and integration with Amazon’s automated product reordering service known as Amazon Dash Replenishment (the **"Service"**) through our developer program for the Service (the **"Program"**).  This agreement is between Amazon Fulfillment Services, Inc. (an **"Amazon Party"**, and together with its affiliates, **"Amazon,"** **"we,"** or **"us"**) and you (if registering as an individual) or the entity you represent (if registering as a business) (**"you"**).  Any other Amazon affiliate that we designate is also an Amazon Party.  

BY REGISTERING FOR THE PROGRAM OR USING THE SERVICE OR ANY PROGRAM MATERIALS (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 1), YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THIS AMAZON DASH REPLENISHMENT PROGRAM AGREEMENT, THE [AMAZON DASH REPLENISHMENT PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS](UPDATE-ME) (**"PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS"**), ALL SCHEDULES TO THIS AGREEMENT TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE (**"SCHEDULES"**), AND ALL TERMS, RULES, REQUIREMENTS, GUIDELINES, AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND MATERIALS PERTAINING TO THE SERVICE PROVIDED OR MADE AVAILABLE TO YOU, INCLUDING ON OUR ONLINE DEVELOPER PORTAL FOR THE PROGRAM (COLLECTIVELY, THIS **"AGREEMENT"**).  IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT, THEN YOU MAY NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM OR USE THE SERVICE.  

**1. Description of the Program**

The purpose of the Program is to enable you to include access to the Service through your devices and applications (collectively, **"Your Products"**) and, once Your Products have been certified by us, allow your users to access the Service through Your Products.  In order to facilitate your use of the Service, we may make available to you images, audio, logos, specifications, code, documents, data, software, software development kits, libraries, application programming interfaces, applications, services and other information, technology, and related materials (**"Program Materials"**).   Some Program Materials may be provided by a third party (**"Third Party Materials"**).  Your use of any Third Party Materials is subject to this Agreement and any third party terms applicable to such Third Party Materials.  Any end user’s use of the Service will also be subject to the terms and conditions we establish for end users from time to time, including but not limited to the [Amazon Dash Replenishment Service Terms of Use](UPDATE-ME).   Use of the Service or Program Materials may not be available in certain jurisdictions.  Some Program Materials may not be available for use with Your Products.

Subject to the terms of your vendor and/or fulfillment agreement(s) with Amazon, Amazon has sole discretion to determine price, availability and terms of sale for each transaction processed by Amazon through the Service.  

**2. Enrollment**  

To begin enrollment, you must complete the registration process for the Program. We will send all notices and other communications regarding the Program to you at the e-mail addresses that you designated for notifications and updates during the registration process or by any other means specified by us.  You will update your e-mail addresses (as well as your legal name, address and phone number) with Amazon as often as necessary to keep them accurate at all times.  

**3. Program Requirements**  

After you have registered, you may access, download and use the Program Materials to include access to the Service from Your Product.  Please review the [Program Requirements](UPDATE-ME) and ensure Your Product complies with the requirements therein.  You will be solely responsible for, and bear all risk and liability for, Your Products, including but not limited to the technical operation, maintenance and end user support of Your Products.  You will not produce or use any packaging, marketing or other materials that identifies or suggests Amazon is the manufacturer of Your Product and you will identify yourself as the manufacturer of Your Products.  You will provide us with access to systems, hardware, software and any information that we request to verify your compliance with this Agreement.  

**4. Indemnification**  

You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Amazon, our licensors, and our and their respective employees, officers, directors, contractors and assigns against all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses arising out of or relating to your use of the Service, participation in the Program, your breach of any provision of this Agreement, or Your Products (individually, a **"Claim"** and collectively, the **"Claims"**), except to the extent that such Claims arise from the gross negligence or willful action or inaction of Amazon. You will not consent to the entry of any judgment or settle any Claims without our prior written consent.  You will use counsel reasonably satisfactory to us to defend any Claims.  If we reasonably determine that a Claim might adversely affect us, we may take control of the defense at our expense (and without limiting your indemnification obligations).  Your obligations under this Section 4 are independent of your other obligations under this Agreement.  You will not assert, authorize, encourage or participate in any patent infringement claim against Amazon with respect to the Service or Program Materials.  

**5. Your Use of Customer Information**  

You will: (a) provide clearly labeled, easily accessible and legally adequate privacy notices to end users, (b) obtain any necessary consent from end users for the collection, use, transfer, and storage of any personal information you collect from end users, including without limitation names, e-mail addresses and other personally identifiable information of end users (collectively, **"Personal Information"**), (c) use and authorize others to access and use Personal Information only for the purposes permitted by the end user, and (d) ensure Personal Information is collected, used, transferred, and stored in accordance with applicable privacy notice(s) and applicable laws.  You will not: (a) use any Personal Information in any way inconsistent with your privacy notice or applicable law or (b) use information received from Amazon regarding a user’s use of the Service for any purposes other than to permit such end user access to the Service through Your Product.  You may disclose Personal Information to a third party only if you do not identify any user (or group of users) as a user of the Service or customer of ours and you ensure that every recipient uses the information only for the purposes for which it was disclosed and complies with the restrictions applicable to you related to that information (including without limitation under this Agreement and your privacy policy).  You are liable to us for any misuse or breach of such restrictions by such recipient.  

**6. Representations**  

You represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are lawfully able to enter into contracts, on behalf of yourself or the entity you represent, in the jurisdictions where you use the Service; (b) you will comply with all applicable laws and other legal, regulatory or policy restrictions or requirements in your performance of your obligations and exercise of your rights under this Agreement or otherwise related to the design, manufacturing, marketing, offer for sale, sale, distribution, use and operation of Your Products, including without limitation export control and trade laws; and (c) nothing submitted to us in connection with your participation in the Program is false or misleading.  

**7. Confidentiality**  

During the course of your enrollment in the Program or use of the Service, you may receive information relating to us, the Service or to the Program that is not known to the general public (**"Confidential Information"**).  You agree that: (a) all Confidential Information will remain our exclusive property; (b) you will use Confidential Information only as is reasonably necessary for your use of the Service in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (c) you will not disclose Confidential Information to any individual, company, or other third party; and (d) you will take all reasonable measures to protect Confidential Information against any use or disclosure that is not expressly permitted in this Agreement.  You may not issue any press release or make any public statement related to the Program or Service (including performance of the Service or results of any benchmark comparisons of the Service to other services), or use our name, trademarks or logos in any way (including in promotional material) without our prior written consent, or misrepresent or embellish the relationship between us in any way.  

**8. Limited License**  

Subject to your compliance with the terms of this Agreement and solely in connection with your participation in the Program and use of the Service, we hereby grant you a limited, revocable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to: (a) access and use the Service in the manner permitted by this Agreement; (b) copy, use, perform, distribute and display the Program Materials solely as necessary for you to access the Service and to enable access to the Service in connection with Your Products, in each case in the manner permitted by this Agreement; and (c) use only those of our trademarks and logos that we give you permission to use (those Amazon trademarks and logos, collectively, the **"Amazon Marks"**) solely in connection with Your Product and in accordance with the Trademark Guidelines available at https://developer.amazon.com/public/support/legal/tuabg, which may be updated from time to time in our discretion.  

You may not do nor authorize any other party to do the following to or with the Service or the Program Materials: (a) reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble them; (b) modify or create derivative works based upon them in whole or in part; (c) distribute copies of them unless otherwise permitted by us; (d) remove any proprietary notices or labels on them; (e) use them with any software, data or content that is licensed under terms that would require that the Service or any Program Materials be disclosed, licensed, distributed, or otherwise made available to anyone; or (f) resell, lease, rent, transfer, sublicense, or otherwise transfer rights to them.  In addition to any other rights or remedies that we may have, any use in violation of this section will immediately terminate your right to use the Service and the Program Materials.  

You hereby give us permission to use your name, logo, screenshots and video of Your Product in our marketing materials to identify you as a participant in the Program and the availability of Your Products.    

**9. Reservation of Rights; Suggestions**  

Other than the limited licenses expressly set forth in Section 8, we reserve all right, title and interest (including all intellectual property and proprietary rights) in and to the Program, our online developer portal for the Program, Service and Program Materials (collectively the **"Service Offerings"**).  If you provide suggestions, ideas, or other feedback to us about the Service Offerings, we will be free to exercise all rights in such feedback without restriction and without compensating you.  Any and all data submitted to the Service in connection with your development, testing and use of Your Products, may be used by Amazon for product development and other internal operations.  

**10. Modifications; Term, Termination and Transition Period**  

We may amend any of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement at any time and in our sole discretion.  Any changes will be effective upon the posting of such changes on our online developer portal for the Program, and you are responsible for reviewing our online developer portal for the Program and informing yourself of all applicable changes or notices.  IF ANY MODIFICATION IS UNACCEPTABLE TO YOU, YOUR ONLY RECOURSE IS TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT. YOUR CONTINUED PARTICIPATION IN THE PROGRAM AND/OR CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICE FOLLOWING OUR POSTING OF ANY CHANGES WILL CONSTITUTE YOUR BINDING ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGE.  The term of this Agreement will begin upon your enrollment in the Program and will end when terminated by either you or us. Either you or we may terminate this Agreement at any time, with or without cause, by giving the other party written notice of termination.  

For twelve (12) months following termination of the Agreement (the **"Transition Period"**), you will continue to comply with the applicable requirements and obligations set forth in this Agreement so as to facilitate our customers’ continued use and access to the Service through Your Products (including those distributed during the Transition Period).  During the Transition Period, without limitation, you will not block or disable any compatibility of Your Products with the Service.  

Following the Transition Period, (a) Amazon may continue marketing, selling and offering Your Products and any of your consumable items designated for sale through Your Products to the extent feasible without your continued participation in the Program and (b) you shall discontinue all use of the Program Materials, delete or destroy copies of the Program Materials in your possession, and, to the extent Amazon is not exercising its right to continue distribution and operation of the Service, as set forth in subsection (a), remove or disable all access to the Service from Your Products.  

Upon any termination of this Agreement and expiration of the Transition Period, all rights and obligations of the parties will be extinguished, except that the rights and obligations of the parties under __Sections 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13, 14__, and __15__ and any other provision that, by its nature, is intended to survive, will survive the termination of this Agreement.  

**11. Changes to the Program**  

We reserve the right to determine and control all aspects (including all functionality) of the Service Offerings that we make available to you.   We may change, improve, correct, or discontinue the Program or any functionality available through the Service or suspend or terminate your access to or use of the Service or any Program Materials at any time for any reason.  

**12. Relationship of Parties**  

You and we are independent contractors, and nothing in this Agreement will create any partnership, joint venture, agency, franchise, sales representative, or employment relationship between you and us.  You will not make any statement, whether in Your Products or otherwise, that contradicts or may contradict anything in this section. You will not disparage us or any of our respective products or services. If you authorize, assist, encourage, or facilitate another person or entity to take any action related to the subject matter of this Agreement, you will be deemed to have taken the action yourself.  

**13. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability**  

THE SERVICE OFFERINGS ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS. WE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM, WITH RESPECT TO ALL THE SERVICE OFFERINGS, ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.  

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE AND OUR LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES (INCLUDING ANY LOSS OF REVENUE, PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, OR DATA) ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE SERVICE OFFERINGS, EVEN IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF THOSE DAMAGES.  

IN ADDITION, AND WITHOUT LIMITING THE FOREGOING, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, OUR (AND OUR LICENSORS’) AGGREGATE LIABILITY ARISING WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE SERVICE OFFERINGS WILL NOT EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (USD 100).  

**14. Disputes**

THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON, WITHOUT REFERENCE TO RULES GOVERNING CHOICE OF LAWS OR THE U.N. CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS. YOU HEREBY IRREVOCABLY CONSENT TO AND WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE COURTS LOCATED AT KING COUNTY, WASHINGTON WITH RESPECT TO ANY CLAIMS, SUITS OR PROCEEDINGS ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.   HOWEVER, WE MAY SEEK INJUNCTIVE (OR SIMILAR) REMEDIES IN ANY JURISDICTION.  

**15. Miscellaneous**  

If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid by a court with jurisdiction over the parties to this Agreement, such provision will be deemed to be restated to reflect as nearly as possible the original intentions of the parties in accordance with applicable law, and the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. You shall be responsible for identifying and paying all taxes and other governmental fees and charges (and any penalties, interest, and other additions thereto) if any, that are imposed upon or with respect to your use of the Service and/or Program as agreed to under this Agreement.  For the transfer of any property by you to us, title will pass upon receipt by us.  For the transfer of any property by us to you, title will pass to you upon delivery to common carrier. Each Amazon Party is severally liable for its own obligations under this Agreement and is not jointly liable for the obligations of other Amazon Parties. You may not assign this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without our express prior written approval.  We may assign this Agreement (or any of our rights and obligations under this Agreement): (a) to any of our affiliates; or (b) in connection with any merger, consolidation, reorganization, sale of all or substantially all of its assets or any similar transaction.  Subject to that restriction, this Agreement will be binding on, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable against the parties and their respective successors and assigns.  Our failure to enforce your strict performance of any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of our right to subsequently enforce such provision or any other provision of this Agreement.  This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter, supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements between the parties with respect to its subject matter, and does not give any third party (except where specified) any rights or remedies hereunder. Any notice or other communication to be given hereunder will be in writing and given (a) by us via email, via a posting on our online developer portal for the Program, or via a message through your Program account, or (b) by you via email to contracts-legal@amazon.com, or to such other email or physical addresses as we may specify from time to time.  The date of receipt will, in the case of email, be deemed the date on which such notice is transmitted.  


__**Referral Fee Schedule**__  

The terms of this Referral Fee Schedule apply if Your Products offer one or more Eligible Consumables (as defined below).  

1. __**Definitions**__.

   "Eligible Consumable" means any third party consumable product (i.e., not one of your consumables) offered for sale through Your Products via the Service.

   "Eligible Purchase" means a bona fide purchase by a customer of an Eligible Consumable through Your Products via the Service during the term of this Agreement and the Transition Period.

   "Referral Fee" means the one percent (1%) referral fee that we pay you for Eligible Purchases, as calculated below, and any additional special or promotional amounts paid in accordance with Section 7 below.

2. __**Eligible Purchases**__.   We will pay you Referral Fees on Eligible Purchases in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Referral Fee Schedule.  Eligible Purchases exclude, and Amazon will not pay Referral Fees on, any order that is (a) canceled, returned or for no fee at all, (b) placed through any of Your Products more than (5) years after the date that it is first registered by an end user with the Service or (c) placed after the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement and the Transition Period.  We will track Eligible Purchases for reporting and payment accrual purposes and will make available to you reports summarizing those Eligible Purchases.

3. __**Payment of Referral Fees**__. Amazon will pay you any Referral Fees approximately 60 days after the end of the calendar month in which the corresponding Eligible Purchases are made (subject to any applicable withholding or deduction described below).  You will receive payment as set forth below.

  a. __Payment by Direct Deposit__. Unless Amazon agrees to make payment by check in accordance with subsection (b) below (only available in the U.S.), Amazon will directly deposit the Referral Fees that you earn into the bank account that you designate, but Amazon may accrue and withhold Referral Fees until the total amount due to you is equal to at least USD 100. You must provide Amazon with all the necessary bank details for payment by direct deposit. If you have not provided this information, or it is not valid (e.g., the account has been closed or changed) or the payment is otherwise rejected by your bank, Amazon may withhold payment until you provide valid information or Amazon may instead make payment by check (subject to the processing fees described below) until you provide valid account information.  
  b. __Payment by Check (only available in the U.S.)__. If approved by Amazon in its sole discretion, Amazon will send you a check in the amount of the Referral Fees that you earn, but Amazon may accrue and withhold Referral Fees until the total amount due to you is at least USD 100. Amazon will deduct a processing fee in the amount of USD 15 from the Referral Fees payable to you for each check Amazon sends to you.  

  Unless otherwise stated, the amounts due to you hereunder are inclusive of any taxes that may apply to such payments. Amazon maintains the right, however, to deduct or withhold any applicable taxes that we may be legally obligated to deduct or withhold from amounts due from Amazon or its affiliates, and the amounts due, as reduced by such deductions or withholdings, will constitute full payment to you. You will provide Amazon with any forms, documents or other certifications as may be requested by Amazon to satisfy any information reporting or tax obligations with respect to this Agreement.

  If at any time following the Effective Date, you are deemed, or are likely to be deemed, a resident of, or as having its principal place of business located in, Arkansas, Colorado, Maine, Missouri, Rhode Island, or Vermont, you will become ineligible to receive payment of Referral Fees and you must promptly notify Amazon in writing of such change in status and the reason thereof.

4. __Calculation of Referral Fees__. Referral Fees will be calculated by multiplying the Referral Fee rate (set forth above in the definition of Referral Fee) by the amount charged by Amazon for each Eligible Purchase, excluding costs for taxes separately stated and charged to the customer, shipping, handling, gift-wrapping fees, service charges, rebates, credit card processing fees, returns, and bad debt.  Notwithstanding any other provision of the Agreement, Referral Fees may be proportionally reduced in respect of Eligible Purchases for which Amazon charges a reduced fee in connection with any advertising or promotional program or campaign.

5. __Specified Device Referral ID__. For each of Your Products, you must: (a) use a properly formatted unique payment identifier received from Amazon (a "Specified Device Referral ID"); and (b) notify Amazon of the build model string for each of Your Products. You must not use any Specified Device Referral ID for any purpose not specifically authorized by Amazon.  You are not entitled to Referral Fees if the Specified Device Referral ID is not used as prescribed by Amazon.  

6. __No Referral Fees to Third Parties__. As between you and Amazon, Amazon’s sole payment obligation in connection with your (and Your Product’s) use of the Service will be the Referral Fees payable to you in accordance with this Referral Fee Schedule. Nothing in the Agreement obligates Amazon to pay any fees to any third party in connection with the distribution of Your Products or use of the Service with any of Your Products. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if Amazon becomes obligated to pay fees to any third party in connection with Service accessed, or products sold via Your Products, Amazon will have the right in its sole discretion to reduce or discontinue payment to you of any Referral Fees.  

7. __Special Offers and Promotions__.  From time to time, Amazon may run special or limited time offers or promotions under which you may earn additional Referral Fees. We may notify you about these special offers or promotions by updating this Referral Fee Schedule or through emails, blog posts, or other means.  Amazon is under no obligation to continue to offer any special offer or promotion under this __Section 7__.

  * The following special offers and promotions are currently available to you:  

    **First Purchase Bounty** – A one-time payment equal to USD 2 that we pay you for the first Eligible Purchase from each of Your Products.  Amazon will determine in its sole discretion, in each case, whether a First Purchase Bounty eligible event has occurred.
